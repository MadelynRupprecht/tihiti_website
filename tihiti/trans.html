                Almost all visitors arrive to Taniti by air, though some arrive on a small cruise ship that docks in Yellow Leaf 
                Bay for one night per week. Taniti is served by a small airport that can accommodate small jets and propeller 
                planes. Taniti is in the process of expanding the airport so larger jets will be able to land on the island 
                within the next few years.

            <p>
                Public buses serve Taniti City and run from 5 a.m. to 11 p.m. every day. Private buses serve the rest of the island. 
                Taxis are available in Taniti City, and rental cars can be rented from a local rental agency near the airport. 
                Bikes and helmets are available to rent from several vendors (helmets are required by law). Taniti City is fairly 
                flat and very walkable. Many tourists stay in the area surrounding Merriton Landing: this area is easy to explore 
                on foot.
